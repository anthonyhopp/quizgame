Now all questions are listed on the page at once rather than one at a time, couldn't figure out how to get the next question to generate when directed back to test.html from score.html
Score is calculated and shows in an alert in the format "X out of Y correct" then it directs you to score.html where your score is displayed again 
    --This will be addressed in my next update
